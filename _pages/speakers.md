**Deep Generative Models for Smart Agriculture**


Deep generative models are neural networks that are capable of learning complex data distributions and have therefore achieved tremendous success in recent years. In general, they can be used for a variety of applications, such as anomaly detection, current state estimation, or forecasting. In this talk, several deep generative models will be presented and how they can be used in agriculture. A particular focus will be on the interpretability of the results, i.e., a human-understandable representation of the results with high information content. One prominent example covered in this talk is an image-based plant growth model utilizing generative adversarial networks to generate the future appearance of plants.
